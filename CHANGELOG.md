### Changed

- Refreshed the Augmentor acceptance matrix to match closed beta.1 issues and epics (#210, #211, #212, #213, #214, #215, #313).
- Documented add-on disable-versus-uninstall semantics, manual cleanup, and capability-chip meaning for testers (#215, #317).

### Fixed

- Fixed Agent Control stop/cancel so runs halt by their own job id and surface recovery state (#226, #301).

### Security

- Enforced Agent Control field-typing boundaries for credential aliases including `passwd`, `pwd`, `pin`, `passkey`, and `security-code` (#224, #282 by @Resonant-Jones, #299).
- Added durable Agent Control trace artifacts with hardened secret redaction and visible step-counter proof (#225, #302).
- Added the add-on governance audit trail for execution toggles and honest capability-contract chips (#215, #317).
- Blocked protected system roots and `~/Library` in browser-first move-import paths at any depth (#319).
- Stabilized live Agent Control certification target discovery and job settling from @Resonant-Jones (#267, #286).
- Added safe click/type/scroll and blocked high-risk Agent Control certification fixtures (#223, #300).

### Security

- Added session-only provider credential handling, scoped capability-token enforcement, renderer-controlled route rejection, and release-scope secret scanning (#85, #89, #143, #183, #184).

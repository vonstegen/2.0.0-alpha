# ResonantOS Browser-First Core Implementation Feature List

Status: active implementation guide  
Scope: browser-first ResonantOS core only  
Out of scope for this phase: processor-specific add-ons, Audio2TOL-specific flows, Hermes-specific internals, OpenCode-specific internals, wallet transaction automation

## Product Direction

ResonantOS is now a browser-first AI workspace. The browser is the primary app surface, and ResonantOS lives inside it as:

- a main new-tab workspace for full-screen Augmentor interaction, projects, history, memory, settings, and add-on entrypoints
- a persistent side-panel workspace for browser-context interaction while the human is browsing
- a host-mediated control layer for browser actions, memory writes, provider access, and future add-on dispatch

The base system must stay useful without optional add-ons. Add-ons may extend it, but the core should not depend on them.

## Core Feature Areas

### 1. Main Workspace

Goal: make the new-tab workspace the main place where the user starts work.

Required behavior:

- New tab opens a clean Augmentor chat by default.
- Main chat and side-panel chat share the same underlying chat capabilities.
- The side-panel chat stays closed when the user is in the main full-screen chat workspace.
- If a task requires browser control, the workspace can shift into browser/task mode while keeping Augmentor visible in the side panel.
- The left rail supports New Chat, Search, Pinned Add-ons, Projects, Chats, Settings, and user/account area.
- Chats can be pinned, unpinned, forked, deleted, and moved into/out of projects.
- Projects represent real work containers, not add-ons.
- A project can contain chats, artifacts, and later code/doc references.
- Settings provides a management surface for active and archived chats/projects so the main workspace rail does not become the only place to organize work.

Current status:

- Main workspace exists.
- Left rail has New Chat, Search, Pinned Add-ons, Projects, Chats, Settings, pin/fork/delete controls, and drag/drop project assignment.
- Project assignment now requires a real active project container; stale project links are cleared during chat-session hydration.
- Left rail chat/project rows expose active-chat and project-expanded ARIA state so persisted rail interactions remain keyboard/screen-reader inspectable.
- Rail search now uses a shared tested matcher for loose chats and projects, so projects remain visible when their name or any contained chat matches the search.
- Settings > Chats & Projects now shows active chats/projects, search, project creation, project rename, project pin/unpin, chat project assignment, archive, restore, confirmation-based delete actions, and recent intake artifact filter/preview/review/export actions.
- Needs deeper validation around empty states, keyboard accessibility, and persisted rail interactions.

### 2. Augmentor Chat

Goal: make Augmentor reliable and consistent in both full-screen and side-panel formats.

Required behavior:

- Blank new chats by default unless the user chooses a previous session.
- Markdown renders as formatted content, not raw syntax.
- Enter sends, Shift+Enter inserts a newline.
- Command+A, Command+C, Command+X, Command+V, Command+Z work in chat inputs.
- Copy, fork, edit, retry, delete, and artifact/intake actions are available where appropriate.
- The composer shows model, context window, attachments, intake/save controls, microphone state, and send action with compact icons.
- Augmentor should not expose internal tool instructions as user-facing answer text.
- Augmentor can delegate from normal chat language through the ResonantOS agent control layer, without requiring the user to manually switch to a separate delegation command surface.
- Natural delegation remains mediated: Hermes, OpenCode, and Resonant Engineer receive governed task packets; add-ons do not become trusted core agents.
- When Augmentor is working, the UI shows what it is doing.

Current status:

- Core chat works against configured providers.
- Keyboard behavior is partially implemented and has passed recent checks.
- Main and side-panel composer parity is partially implemented.
- Natural language delegation routing is implemented for Hermes, OpenCode, and Resonant Engineer so Augmentor does not incorrectly deny delegated work when the target is clear.
- Delegation routing has been hardened so “spawn,” “dispatch,” and “agent control layer” phrasing is intercepted before provider chat, and the provider prompt tells Augmentor that governed delegation is a ResonantOS capability.
- Hermes status routing is implemented so `/hermes` and `/hermes status` report CLI detection, execution grant state, dashboard state, task counts, and the next action instead of creating vague empty task packets.
- Needs deterministic end-to-end UI verification after each composer change.

### 3. Agent Control Mode

Goal: make Augmentor able to operate the current webpage in a Comet-level pattern while preserving human approval for sensitive actions.

Required behavior:

- Augmentor can observe the current page.
- Augmentor can plan browser actions.
- Augmentor can click, type, scroll, navigate, and verify results through safe host-mediated commands.
- The human sees a persistent AI-control overlay while the browser is under agent control.
- The overlay shows the current action, such as reading, clicking, typing, taking screenshot, working, or waiting for approval.
- The human can stop an active run.
- Stopping an active Agent Control run records the stopped step in the durable trace instead of only changing the top-level job status.
- Sensitive actions, credential entry, wallet actions, checkout, public posting, and irreversible actions require explicit approval or are blocked.
- Browser jobs are logged as structured artifacts.

Current status:

- Agent control mode exists and can complete several tested browsing/search/cart/booking scenarios.
- Approval gates exist.
- Overlay exists and has been iterated toward Comet-like behavior.
- Page overlay now updates per active/blocked/failed step with the current action label and phase, instead of only showing a generic run-level state.
- Agent Control progress summaries now distinguish successful completion from terminal resolution, so blocked/failed steps are visible without pretending the task fully completed.
- Agent Control now performs post-action page-state verification for successful browser mutation/navigation steps and records uncertainty when no visible state change is detected.
- Agent Control now prevents repeated identical actions after a no-visible-change verification result, so it stops with guidance instead of looping on the same click/type/navigation.
- Agent Control now records page-specific recovery options for failed, no-change, and repeat-blocked actions. These options list visible candidate controls/fields where possible and are preserved in the monitor, durable browser job state, and saved reports.
- Agent Control now uses a deterministic task-class runbook for planning and next-action requests, including phases, safety stops, visible evidence, and completion checks. Strategy phase/rationale/completion-check evidence is preserved in the monitor, durable browser job state, and saved reports.
- Task-class runbooks now resolve into real-site scenarios: shopping comparison/discovery, booking discovery, news/web research synthesis, DAO/wallet review, safe form editing, and generic page control. Each scenario defines preferred probes, success signals, and stop conditions before the model chooses a browser action.
- The Agent Control monitor now shows a strategy card with the active scenario, phase, success signals, stop boundaries, and preferred probes so the human can see the runbook Augmentor is following while it operates.
- Cancelled runs now surface as stopped, preserve the interrupted step, and sync that trace back to the browser job record.
- Durable browser jobs now flag stale running/approval work when no progress has been recorded for the threshold window; `/jobs` and the monitor show last-activity timing plus recommended human action without silently changing job state.
- Durable browser jobs support multiple simultaneous queued/running/approval jobs with explicit tab/site locks, scheduler capacity state, per-job pause/cancel/focus/continue/report controls, and public-submit approval controls where applicable.
- The durable browser job scheduler preserves blocked/approval/failed control-loop outcomes and does not mark them completed when a runner returns a non-success result.
- The full-screen main workspace now shows an Agent Control status strip for active browser jobs with focused job status, target, scheduler counts, progress, Open Monitor, Focus, and Stop controls. This keeps long-running browser work visible even when the side-panel monitor is closed.
- Main workspace browser-job actions now use a dedicated controller for Open Monitor, Focus, and Stop, with deterministic coverage for sidebar handoff prompts, active-job focus, cancellation, page-lock release, and terminal-job protection.
- Background browser-job approval is tied to page focus: Focus and approval actions activate the job's locked readable tab before replaying a pending action, preventing accidental approval against the wrong visible page.
- Live browser-host validation proves one tab can remain parked at a human approval boundary while a non-conflicting job on another tab completes.
- Approval-state browser jobs show page-specific review evidence: pending action, reason, observed page title, URL, locked tab/site target, and a reminder to inspect the visible page before approval.
- Wallet/DAO helpers are read-only by design: wallet status detection, DAO workflow guidance, and wallet/DAO audit artifacts identify visible governance controls and fields while stopping before wallet connect, signing, voting, transfers, transaction confirmation, or public submission.
- DAO deterministic and live fixtures cover common governance patterns such as connect wallet, vote for/against/abstain, execute/queue transaction, treasury recipient, quorum, deadline, and treasury-transfer evidence.
- Blocked browser-control delegations now carry a bounded context packet for the receiving add-on agent, including source run id, controlled target, progress, blocker reason, recent trace, and authority boundaries.
- The Add-ons workspace now exposes recent governed delegation packets for Hermes, OpenCode, and Resonant Engineer, including source and context-packet evidence.
- Needs stronger action trace, long-run resilience, and broader deterministic fixture tests.

### 4. Living Archive Core

Goal: implement the LLM Wiki memory pattern as a core memory system without add-on lock-in.

Required behavior:

- Preserve human/source knowledge separately from AI-curated memory.
- Maintain a governed intake/review/draft/verify/promote pipeline.
- Connected folders and Obsidian vaults can be registered as memory sources.
- Source scan classifies files before intake.
- Move-on-import must never silently destroy source data: it requires explicit confirmation, writes a manifest/ledger, verifies destination hashes before registration, automatically rolls back earlier moved files after partial failure, and only registers a source when the host move status is fully `moved`.
- Compatible text/markdown/json/csv files can become governed intake artifacts.
- Raw audio/media stays classified but is not directly ingested by the base system.
- AI Memory wiki promotion remains controlled by the Living Archive pipeline, not arbitrary add-on writes.
- The system keeps index/log/review/promotion artifacts clear and auditable.

Current status:

- Memory root and Living Archive pipeline exist.
- Connected source settings, folder browse, scan, enable/disable/remove, source review, and selected-file governed intake exist.
- Move-on-import is host-mediated and guarded by preflight, exact confirmation phrase, byte-hash verification, rollback ledger, partial-failure rollback, and rollback hash checks.
- Review, draft, verification, promotion, and restore flows exist.
- Wiki health now checks for missing `index.md`/`log.md`, broken wiki links, orphan pages, duplicate titles, and pages missing from `index.md`.
- Source file intake now records content hashes and source versions, rejects unchanged duplicate imports, and preserves the original connected source.
- Source version history is visible from Connected Source Review, using the host-managed source version manifest.
- Connected Source Review marks compatible files as new, changed, unchanged, or tracked against the source version manifest.
- Host bridge self-tests now cover selected source-file intake capability gating, duplicate rejection, path traversal rejection, batch capping, and rollback after artifact write failure.
- Changed/tracked compatible files can open a bounded diff preview against the last governed intake artifact.
- Connected Source Review can create governed intake from all new/changed compatible files in one action while skipping unchanged files.
- Wiki lint can now run through a host-mediated Living Archive action, write a durable `REVIEW/lint` artifact, and append a `lint` event to `AI_MEMORY/wiki/log.md` without modifying trusted AI Memory pages.
- Needs richer source-change approval UX.

### 5. Settings

Goal: make Settings a coherent control center, not a scattered debug page.

Required sections:

- Overview and system health
- Provider Profiles
- Model Routing and cost strategy
- Browser and Agent Control
- Memory / Living Archive
- Projects and Workspaces
- Add-ons
- Privacy and Permissions
- Diagnostics and Logs
- About / Version / Updates

Required behavior:

- Settings should use a left sub-navigation inside the main workspace.
- Each section should have clear user-facing explanation and compact controls.
- Dangerous or privileged operations must be explicit and reversible where possible.
- Provider credentials must not be exposed raw in the UI.

Current status:

- Settings exists and has a modular implementation baseline.
- Memory source management is implemented.
- Overview now exposes Open Diagnostics, Export Report, and governed Resonant Engineer recovery handoff actions.
- Needs information architecture cleanup against the current feature list.

### 6. Add-on Platform Boundary

Goal: keep ResonantOS modular without letting add-ons become trusted core by accident.

Required behavior:

- Core includes add-on registry and capability model.
- Base install may show pinned add-on entrypoints, but add-ons are optional.
- Add-ons declare capabilities.
- ResonantOS mediates provider, memory, browser, filesystem, and future wallet access.
- Add-on-specific flows stay out of base core unless implemented as generic contracts.

Current status:

- Add-on manifest/draft surfaces exist.
- Pinned add-on UI exists.
- Add-on status now exposes requested, granted, and denied capability metadata for core-visible add-ons.
- Settings > Add-ons renders granted, needs-review, and denied capability groups so users can inspect trust posture without granting new authority from the screen.
- Processor-specific add-on workflows are deferred.
- Needs install/enable/disable UX validation and future host-mediated grant/revoke flows.

### 7. Provider Fabric

Goal: route AI work according to user strategy, capability, cost, and availability.

Required behavior:

- User can configure provider profiles.
- The system supports primary and fallback routes.
- Routing considers workload type, quality needs, cost, local/cloud availability, and recovery mode.
- Missing credentials produce clear actionable errors.
- Provider access is mediated by ResonantOS.

Current status:

- Provider profile and routing implementation exists.
- MiniMax integration has been used successfully.
- Provider Settings now shows host vault state, credential presence, model cost/quality metadata, and routing strategies that depend on each provider.
- Provider Settings can run a host-mediated readiness check for each provider without exposing credentials or spending model tokens.
- Provider Settings links directly to centralized Routing so users can adjust model/fallback strategy from the provider profile flow.
- Provider Settings can save per-provider allowed-model policy, and provider routing ignores disabled models for both Auto routing and manual model selection.
- Provider Settings has an explicit user-triggered connectivity test that checks bounded provider endpoint reachability without sending prompts or model generation requests.
- Provider Settings shows bounded, redacted provider diagnostics history so repeated auth/network failures are visible without rerunning checks.
- Provider Settings derives recovery suggestions from recent diagnostics history, including credential recovery, missing credential, network-route instability, and reachable/no-action states.
- Chat composers now include an Auto route option. Auto route sends the Augmentor Chat workload to the host so the provider fabric can apply the user-approved primary/fallback strategy.
- Provider fallback behavior now has deterministic coverage for primary subscription routing, disabled-model fallback, paid escalation, hard-stop no-route behavior, and local recovery fallback.
- Needs deeper provider-specific runbooks after recovery suggestions identify the failure class.

### 8. Deterministic Testing And Release Discipline

Goal: every implemented slice must be tested before being called done.

Required checks:

- Focused unit/contract tests for the changed area.
- Full browser-first test suite after meaningful changes.
- Production build before release/push.
- App install/reopen after app-shell changes.
- Screenshot or UI-level verification after visual/frontend changes when practical.

Current baseline commands:

```bash
node --test browser-first/test/*.test.mjs
npm run test:browser-first
npm run test:browser-first-live
npm run build
npm run browser-first:install
npm run browser-first:verify-installed
```

Rust/Tauri checks apply only when the legacy Tauri app is changed.

## Immediate Core Sequence

1. Stabilize current core after the recent UI/settings/memory work.
2. Complete Settings information architecture and Provider Profiles UX.
3. Strengthen main workspace chat/session/project persistence.
4. Improve Agent Control Mode trace, status, stop controls, and deterministic fixtures. Current baseline includes multi-tab scheduler live coverage, approval evidence cards, and DAO/wallet fixture coverage; next work should focus on deeper real-site runbooks and accessibility/keyboard coverage.
5. Expand Living Archive core wiki health/lint/versioning tests.
6. Validate real local CLI execution enablement UX for Hermes and OpenCode. Both add-ons now have governed packet lifecycle routes, deterministic start/read-result coverage, explicit opt-in before real local CLI execution, and fake-runtime enabled-CLI adapter tests that validate the production handoff without relying on live user runtimes.
7. Improve add-on capability review UI without implementing processor-specific add-ons.
8. Run full deterministic verification and push only after green checks.

# Recipe: Education and progress tracking

Education and progress-tracking example from the Augmentor Future List.
Captures course pages, syllabus content, and progress milestones into the
Living Archive so the human can review them across restarts, while leaving
every enrollment, payment, and forum post to the human.

## Goal

Open a course page (or several), capture the syllabus and assessment plan,
summarise upcoming milestones, and save a continuing-learning intake to the
Living Archive that survives a session restart.

## Safe automated steps

The Augmentor can:

- Extract the course title, provider, duration, prerequisites, and
  assessment plan from a course page.
- Summarise the syllabus into a week-by-week reading list with citations
  (`#218` and `#221`).
- Save a continuing-learning intake to the Living Archive that lists
  the open tabs and the human's chosen milestones (per `#227`).
- Resume after a restart and confirm the previously captured syllabus and
  intake match the open tabs (per `#228`).
- Search local browser history for prior course-related searches to avoid
  duplication (`/history` command).

## Human-only checkpoints

The Augmentor **must not** perform any of these autonomously:

- **Enroll** in any course, certificate program, or cohort.
- **Pay** for a course, subscription, or exam voucher.
- **Post** in any course forum, study group, or cohort chat with the
  human's account.
- **Submit** any assignment, quiz, or exam answer.
- **Connect or sign** with any identity or learning-platform SSO on the
  human's behalf.
- **Add** the course schedule to a calendar.

Every one of those steps stops for an explicit human handoff per
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) and the
[Augmentor tester runbook](../augmentor-tester-runbook.md#4-human-only-boundaries-verify-these-refuse).
The intake is **not** a confirmed enrollment; it is a draft the human
takes to the platform.

## Suggested prompts

- "Summarise this course page as title, provider, weeks, prerequisites,
  assessments. Cite each section you read."
- "Build a week-by-week reading list from this syllabus. Cite each week."
- "Save the syllabus and my chosen milestones to my Living Archive intake
  as a continuing-learning capture."
- "After I restart, confirm the syllabus and milestones still match the
  open tabs."

## Evidence to capture

- The week-by-week reading list with each citation.
- The Living Archive intake item id for the continuing-learning capture.
- A screenshot of the human-only checklist above being shown in the side
  panel after the human reviews the milestones.

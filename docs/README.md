# ResonantOS Documentation Router

Use this page after reading the canonical contributor path:
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), [README.md](../README.md),
[INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md), and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

Current implementation facts belong in [Status](STATUS.md). Accepted release
scope, area, and delivery state belong in
[Project 2](https://github.com/orgs/ResonantOS/projects/2) under the rules in
[Project Governance](PROJECT_GOVERNANCE.md).

## Understand The Alpha Runtime

- [Alpha Runtime Boundary](architecture/ALPHA_RUNTIME_BOUNDARY.md) defines the
  extension, bridge, authentication, generated files, and excluded systems.
- [Product Guide](product/PRODUCT_GUIDE.md) explains stable user workflows.
- [Capability Matrix](reference/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md) maps implemented,
  experimental, and deferred capabilities to tests and issues.
- [Augmentor Future List acceptance matrix](augmentor-future-list-acceptance-matrix.md)
  maps every Augmentor feature family to its canonical issue, status, required
  tests/proof, and safety boundary.
- [Augmentor tester runbook & proof checklist](augmentor-tester-runbook.md) walks a
  community tester from install to a proof checklist, with the human-only boundaries.
- [Design](design/README.md) indexes the community-contributed ROSI design
  system — the token catalog extracted from the live Browser extension UI,
  the visual reference for new panels and add-ons.
- [Augmentor workflow recipes](recipes/index.md) give safe, copy-paste-able
  Augmentor flows and human-only checkpoints for job search, travel,
  education/tracking, and product research (issue #237).
- [Side-Panel Command Reference](reference/COMMANDS.md) lists the supported
  Augmentor slash commands and their safety boundaries.
- [Status](STATUS.md) records the latest verified snapshot.

## Change The Extension

Start with [browser-first component instructions](../browser-first/README.md),
then read [Module Map](architecture/MODULE_MAP.md),
[Module Ownership](architecture/MODULE-OWNERSHIP.md), and the relevant entry in
the [Capability Matrix](reference/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md).

## Change The Bridge

Start with [bridge component instructions](../browser-first/host/README.md),
then read the [Alpha Runtime Boundary](architecture/ALPHA_RUNTIME_BOUNDARY.md)
and [Module Ownership](architecture/MODULE-OWNERSHIP.md). Preserve bridge-token,
capability-token, loopback, secret, and human-only action boundaries.

## Change Provider Routing

Read [ADR-005: Provider Fabric Routing](architecture/ADR-005-provider-fabric-routing.md),
[Module Ownership](architecture/MODULE-OWNERSHIP.md), and the provider entries in
the [Capability Matrix](reference/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md). Provider secrets remain
host-owned local state and must not cross into extension storage or logs.

## Change Agent Control

Read the browser-control sections of the
[Product Guide](product/PRODUCT_GUIDE.md), the
[Capability Matrix](reference/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md), the
[Side-Panel Command Reference](reference/COMMANDS.md), and
[Module Ownership](architecture/MODULE-OWNERSHIP.md). Use the issue and Project 2
item to determine required live-browser proof and human-only actions.

## Change Living Archive

Read [ADR-007: Living Archive Boundaries](architecture/ADR-007-living-archive-boundaries.md),
[ADR-011: Living Archive Host Service](architecture/ADR-011-living-archive-host-service.md),
[ADR-012: Approval Policy](architecture/ADR-012-living-archive-approval-policy.md),
and [Module Ownership](architecture/MODULE-OWNERSHIP.md) before changing intake,
review, promotion, or trusted-memory writes.

## Change An Add-On

Read [ADR-006: Add-On Runtime SDK](architecture/ADR-006-addon-runtime-sdk.md),
[ADR-018: Add-on SDK V0](architecture/ADR-018-addon-sdk-v0.md),
[ADR-055: Resonant Extension Framework](architecture/ADR-055-resonant-extension-framework.md)
(extends ADR-006/018 toward public/third-party add-ons), and
[ADR-056: Provider Fabric Boundary for External Agent Runtimes](architecture/ADR-056-provider-fabric-boundary-external-agent-runtimes.md)
(boundary for third-party agent runtimes like DeepSeek Harness or Agent Zero),
[ADR-023: Add-On Repository And Registry](architecture/ADR-023-addon-repository-registry-model.md),
and [Module Ownership](architecture/MODULE-OWNERSHIP.md). The Resonant
Extension Framework package lives at
[Framework package README](addons/resonant-extension-framework/README.md).
For the separate controlled Chromium package, use its
[component README](../addons/resonant-browser-host/README.md).

## Change Documentation

Keep current status in [Status](STATUS.md), future scope in
[Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and Project 2, architectural decisions in the
[ADR Index](architecture/README.md), and stable workflows in the Product Guide.
Run:

```bash
npm run docs:check
npm run test:docs
```

## Release The Alpha

Use [Alpha Distribution](release/ALPHA_DISTRIBUTION.md),
[Status](STATUS.md), the [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md),
[Beta.1 Release Notes](RELEASE_NOTES_BETA1.md),
[Security Policy](../SECURITY.md), and Project 2. Release evidence must identify
the exact commands and live Chrome checks performed.

## Inspect Decision History

Use the [ADR Index](architecture/README.md). An ADR's decision status and its
applicability to the current Alpha are separate facts; historical and deferred
records do not redefine the runtime boundary.

## Review Packets

Dated review packets snapshot the state of work submitted to upstream
reviewers. Each packet links to the live PR and records the commits,
validation results, and review asks at the time of submission.

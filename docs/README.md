## Usage Rule

When a new structural decision is made, add or update an ADR before the codebase drifts.

When a refactor changes ownership or service boundaries, update these in the same change:

- `architecture/MODULE_MAP.md`
- `architecture/MODULE-OWNERSHIP.md`
- `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md`
- the relevant ADR if the rule itself changed

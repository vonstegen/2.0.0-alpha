  - `resonantos-side-panel-extension/src/lib/chat-session-store.js` owns chat/fork/attachment state, hydration, persistence, and regeneration trimming; side-panel rendering consumes this store instead of mutating raw arrays

  - runtime status surface
  - `ArchiveSearchPanel` trusted wiki/source search and source queueing surface

  - `chat-interface` and `memory-system` availability gates used by the shell
  - cross-window runtime-state event sync for main shell and floating chat surfaces

## Composition Rule

`src/App.tsx` is the shell composition root. It may:

- load state
- route sections to modules
- pass props and callbacks
- host top-level shell chrome

It should not own detailed feature rendering for module surfaces, large mutation workflows, or substantial derived-view selectors.

Guardrails:

- prefer module `controller.ts` files for orchestration/mutations
- prefer module `selectors.ts` files for heavy read-only derivation
- when `App.tsx` shrinks, update this map and the backlog in the same change
- if `App.tsx` grows again, treat that as drift to fix, not as the new normal

## Next Moves

- redesign the shell around `docs/product/UX-001-resonantos-app-shell.md`
- split shell chrome into reusable layout primitives for left rail, center workspace, and chat rail
- replace the settings-like Overview surface with a Home / Apps launcher
- add active workspace state for center-launched add-ons
- evolve Obsidian from read-only vault bridge into the ADR-019 hosted Obsidian-compatible workspace after write/audit host commands exist
- evolve Browser from one-shot Chromium capture into a persistent controlled Chromium sidecar session
- add module-local tests for `overview`, `strategist`, `archive`, `addons`, and `settings`
- continue shrinking shell-owned orchestration logic, especially remaining state commit/update helpers and top-level shell wiring in `src/App.tsx`
- introduce clearer IPC boundaries as Rust-side services expand
- continue evolving trusted wiki promotion from whole-page generated writes into schema-aware merge workflows
- split any future oversized Rust host module before it regains mixed persistence + execution + recovery concerns

# Module Ownership

## Purpose

This document is the normative contributor-facing ownership contract. Use it
before adding a module, moving behavior across modules, changing shared state,
or changing an authenticated bridge route.

The [Alpha runtime boundary](ALPHA_RUNTIME_BOUNDARY.md) defines what ships. The
[module map](MODULE_MAP.md) describes the repository layout. The
[ADR index](README.md) separates decision status from Alpha applicability.

Workspace and Settings controllers supply browser-job mutation intents to the
store module. The external helper coordinates read/prepare/write operations only
within one storage adapter, jobs key, and JavaScript realm. Each live store keeps
its own queue and failed-read guard; this is not cross-page atomicity or shared
serialization with store writes.

The clear policies intentionally differ: Settings removes completed, blocked,
denied, cancelled, and failed jobs, including focused terminal jobs. Side-panel
“Clear done” removes only completed, cancelled, and denied jobs and preserves the
focused job. Both paths use the store module's durable sanitation boundary.

## Shared Source Ownership

`src/`, `src/sdk/`, `public/addons/`, `addons/`, `examples/`, and `scripts/`
are supporting, shared, optional, or future-facing paths. They are not extra
required Alpha processes.

| Path | Primary owner | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/core/harness-client.ts` | In-memory host projection, monotonic acknowledgements, and session event delivery for React | Sends install, enable/disable, atomic grants and remove transactions; reads only authenticated host snapshots/events through `web-transport.ts`; never creates grants, owners, candidates, availability, or persisted governance |
| `src/core/defaults.ts` | Catalog and recommended-request suggestions | May describe uninstalled, ungranted candidates; must not establish consent or active slot owners |
| `src/core/runtime.ts` | UI-state hydration and serialization | Reads governance only from authenticated host projection; persisted UI state excludes installations, grants, owners and candidates; development mode grants no authority |
| `src/modules/shell/system-slots.ts` | Host-projected slot selection and availability | Catalog metadata may describe the acknowledged owner; missing projection or owner is unavailable, including no-manifest fixtures; no local selection or catalog-order fallback |
| `src/core/memory-provider.ts` | Memory transport adapter for the acknowledged memory-system owner | Reads the harness-client projection; dispatches only to that owner, never the first eligible catalog entry or implicit Living Archive; local config supplies transport settings, never selection or grants |
| `src/modules/shell/selectors.ts` | Chat availability and displayed slot identity | Reads the same harness-client projection as dispatch; local identity and installation fields cannot select a slot owner |
| `packages/addon-sdk/src/surface-routing.ts` | Manifest surface dock routes | Reads acknowledged installations, slot owners, grants and hidden surfaces from the harness-client projection; catalog metadata and local installations confer no availability |
| `src/core/` | Shared contracts and pure cross-domain policy | No feature-specific UI or privileged process/filesystem behavior |
| `packages/addon-sdk/src/` and `src/sdk/addons/` compatibility exports | Canonical add-on manifests, capability vocabulary, protocols, and validation shared by Node and browser consumers | SDK contracts do not grant runtime capabilities |
| `src/modules/addons/AddOnsWorkspace.tsx` | Harness management presentation, bounded manifest import, and pending/conflict feedback | Reads acknowledged `harness-client.ts` projections; sends explicit install/grant/slot/remove commands; never infers grants, ownership, availability, or credential authority |
| `src/modules/addons/controller.ts` | Add-on mutations and the five workspace access presets | Sends host transactions through `harness-client.ts`; applies consent only after acknowledgement; local preferences and config remain separate |
| `src/modules/addons/` | Add-on catalog, grants, setup, and workspace entrypoints | Host mutations stay behind add-on routes and SDK capability policy |
| `src/modules/archive/` | Living Archive UI, intake, review, promotion, and source management | Trusted writes stay behind archive review and promotion routes |
| `src/modules/browser/` | Shared/legacy browser workspace presentation | Alpha page actions stay in extension controllers |
| `src/modules/chat/harness-turn.ts` | Primary harness session reuse, host history/model selection, attributed streams, and interrupted partial replies | App-owned ephemeral state; all harness calls use `harness-client.ts`; host generations fence output; no provider prerequisites, credentials, governance writes, or browser-tool execution |
| `src/modules/chat/thread-controller.ts` | Chat/thread actions and Stop dispatch | Cancels only the registered harness session/turn, preserves the interrupted partial, and invalidates the local run before accepting more output |
| `src/modules/chat/` | Conversation UI, composer, threads, and turn orchestration | Provider credentials and routing stay host-side |
| `src/modules/compute/` | Deferred Compute Fabric UI model | No privileged execution authority |
| `src/modules/delegation/` | Delegation monitoring and result review | Runtime execution stays behind host-mediated add-on routes |
| `src/modules/hermes/` | Optional Hermes workspace presentation | Hermes is not a core or required runtime |
| `src/modules/obsidian/` | Deferred notes and vault workspace | Filesystem access stays host-mediated |
| `src/modules/opencode/` | Optional OpenCode workspace presentation | OpenCode remains an optional local service |
| `src/modules/overview/` | Shared overview and workbench framing | UI navigation only |
| `src/modules/paperclip/` | Deferred Paperclip workspace presentation | Development-only add-on boundary |
| `src/modules/recovery/` | Recovery product workflow | Recovery tools remain bounded and audited |
| `src/modules/settings/` | Shared settings UI and controllers | Secrets stay host-side |
| `src/modules/shell/controller.ts` | Shell boot with the acknowledged host projection and explicit first-run selection of bundled Augmentor and Living Archive | Passes the host projection to hydration and shell consumers; sequences existing harness install, enable, grant and slot commands; only acknowledgements establish authority; writes local setup/layout preferences, never local installations, grants or owners |
| `src/modules/shell/` | Shared React shell hydration, selectors, and composition | Keep domain mutations in their feature owners |
| `src/modules/strategist/` | Strategist identity, channels, and thread organization | Chat execution remains in the chat owner |
| `src/App.tsx` | React composition only | Passes one harness-client projection to memory, identity and surface consumers; Living Archive workspace and dock require projected ownership and a visible surface; local state cannot restore them; no governance mutations |
| `public/addons/` | Bundled manifest/catalog data | Manifest presence is not install, enablement, or grant authority |
| `addons/resonant-browser-host/` | Optional browser-host add-on package | Not the required Alpha bridge or browser runtime |
| `examples/` | Optional examples | Never required for Alpha startup |
| `scripts/` | Repository validation and development tooling | Not shipped runtime authority |
| `scripts/vite-dev-bridge-config.mjs` | Opt-in, authenticated development-page config delivery | May read bridge-generated config at request time and write only authorized HTTP responses and in-memory nonce state; must not own bridge auth, capabilities, CORS defaults, provider credentials, extension state, or production artifacts |

If two domains need the same data shape or pure helper, place it in
`src/core/` or the established SDK layer. Shared placement does not transfer
ownership of behavior.

## State And Data Flow

1. Extension modules may read browser state and bounded bridge responses.
2. Extension modules mutate browser/page state only through Chrome APIs,
   content-script controls, and approval policy.
3. Privileged local reads and writes cross `bridge-client.js` and a declared
   bridge route.
4. `bridge-server.mjs` authenticates transport; the named route service owns
   domain validation and resource policy.
5. Provider credentials remain in bridge process memory or the exported bridge
   environment. They never become browser storage or repository state.
6. Local state defaults to `~/ResonantOS_User`; approved external source roots
   remain explicit inputs, not implicit filesystem authority.
7. Wallet, payment, login, credential, signing, transfer, destructive, and
   public-submit actions remain human-only regardless of UI consent state.

`POST /agent/dispose` belongs to `harness-host-service.mjs` and requires
`addon-runtime-control`, bridge authentication and loopback Host validation. It
accepts only an exact host-issued session reference, refuses superseded generations,
and idempotently closes the session and stream through `harness-boundary.mjs`.
It accesses only existing adapter cleanup; host-service and boundary tests cover
the route. React disposes orphaned post-create sessions through `harness-client.ts`.

`POST /addons/enabled` belongs to `harness-host-service.mjs`, requires
`addon-runtime-control` plus bridge authentication and loopback Host validation,
and accepts only `addonId`, boolean `enabled`, and `expectedRevision`. The registry
checks the revision before durable mutation; denial changes no consent. It accesses
only registry state and existing execution cleanup, with no new filesystem or
network destinations. Host-service and route-capability tests cover this boundary.

## Host And IPC Boundary

`src-tauri/src/` is not present in this checkout and has no Alpha ownership.
The authenticated Node bridge is the current IPC-like privileged boundary.

### Host Route Contract

Every new or changed host route must identify:

- one primary owner service;
- its method and exact path;
- whether the bridge token alone is sufficient or which scoped capability is
  required;
- the provider, network endpoint, process, or filesystem roots it may access;
- input validation and redaction rules;
- focused tests in `browser-first/test/` or the owning package.

Do not add domain behavior directly to `run-bridge-minimal.mjs`. Do not move
authentication or capability enforcement out of `bridge-server.mjs`. Do not
treat an extension button, hidden control, or confirmation copy as an
authorization boundary.

## Historical Runtime Ownership

Tauri, Electron, native CEF, Rust/Cargo, custom Chromium packaging, external
browser sidecars, terminal workspaces, and Audio2TOL have no Alpha runtime
ownership. Historical ADRs may describe those systems, but new Alpha work must
not assign routes, secrets, process control, packaging, or validation to them.

Future native/browser-distribution work requires an explicit release scope and
an ownership update before implementation. It does not inherit Alpha bridge
authority automatically.

## Pull Request Checklist Hook

When a pull request adds a module, moves behavior between modules, changes
shared state, or changes a bridge route, answer all of these:

- Which path owns the behavior after this change?
- What state does it read, and what state may it mutate?
- Does any shared contract belong in `src/core/` or an SDK package?
- Does the change cross browser, provider, network, process, filesystem,
  credential, archive-promotion, or human-approval boundaries?
- Which bridge capability protects the route?
- Which focused test proves the boundary?
- Do this ownership contract, the module map, the Alpha boundary, or an ADR
  need an update in the same pull request?

Run the focused ownership check:

```bash
node --test --test-concurrency=1 scripts/module-ownership-doc.test.mjs
```

## Drift Handling

- If an entrypoint accumulates domain logic, move it to the named owner.
- If a route service mixes unrelated provider, filesystem, process, or policy
  responsibilities, split it before adding another privileged operation.
- If docs and executable paths disagree, treat the executable Alpha path as
  evidence, correct the normative docs, and record a new ADR when the decision
  itself changes.
- If ownership cannot be named, stop and resolve it before implementation.

# ResonantOS Feature Inventory

Date: 2026-05-26
Branch: `browser-first-preview`
Product direction: browser-first ResonantOS, with the desktop vNext implementation retained as the reference platform and feature reservoir.

This document separates three things that must not be confused:

- **Browser-first working set**: features already implemented and validated in the current browser-first app path.
- **Browser-first next work**: features we are about to add or deepen next.
- **Desktop vNext feature inventory**: features present in the existing Tauri/desktop ResonantOS vNext codebase that still matter, even if they have not yet been ported into the browser-first shell.

## 1. Browser-First Working Set

These are the features currently implemented in the browser-first version.

### Browser Host

- ResonantOS now has a browser-first product path documented by `ADR-037-browser-first-chromium-resonantos`.
- The product path is a Chromium-family browser app with ResonantOS living inside browser chrome.
- The current app installs locally as `~/Applications/ResonantOS Browser.app`.
- The installed app is replaced by `npm run browser-first:install` after updates.
- The native Browser host uses the CEF-based `ResonantBrowserNativeHost` path.
- The browser host loads the ResonantOS side-panel extension by default.
- The browser host loads Phantom Wallet into the same browser profile when the local Phantom extension is available.
- The browser host pins the ResonantOS extension and Phantom extension in the profile configuration.
- The browser host supports deterministic local testing through a controlled remote-debugging port.
- The Browser host is not the old Tauri webview browser and is not an external Chrome/Brave control workaround.

### ResonantOS Side Panel

- ResonantOS is exposed as a browser side panel.
- The browser-first app opens to the main workspace by default; the side panel opens only when the user explicitly opens it or when a browser-control handoff needs the side-panel control surface.
- The side panel contains the Augmentor chat interface.
- The side panel is intended to remain beside the webpage, not replace the webpage.
- The side panel can be hidden or shown through the extension control.
- The side panel is packaged as a Chromium Manifest V3 extension.
- The side panel has browser-level permissions for active tab access, scripting, tabs, history, side panel, clipboard read/write, and web navigation.

### Augmentor Chat

- Augmentor chat works inside the browser side panel.
- Augmentor chat also works in the browser new-tab main workspace as a full-screen chat surface.
- The main workspace and side-panel chat share the same keyboard behavior for Enter, Shift+Enter, select-all, copy, cut, paste, and undo; native browser editing is not intercepted unless the explicit fallback path is requested.
- The main workspace and side-panel chat share the same message-action semantics: copy, fork, edit user prompt, regenerate, save assistant output to Living Archive intake, stats when available, and delete.
- The main workspace rail is navigation-only; chat history is no longer shown in that rail.
- New chat creation is available from the main workspace top bar rather than the workspace rail history area.
- Provider calls route through the local browser-first bridge.
- Current provider profile display is visible in the composer.
- Model selection is present in the composer.
- Thinking depth selection is present in the composer.
- Intake action affordance is present in the composer.
- Attachment affordance is present in the composer.
- Microphone affordance is present, but full dictation remains dependent on runtime permission/provider support.
- Context percentage indicator is present.
- Context percentage uses the compact vNext-style pill affordance.
- Send button is icon-based.
- The chat starts without the earlier hardcoded placeholder assistant message.
- Chat supports Markdown rendering.
- Chat supports copy, fork, edit, regenerate, save/intake, and delete message actions.
- Chat supports multiple session state through the browser extension storage layer.
- Chat transcript persists across panel reloads.
- Chat input supports Enter to send.
- Chat input supports Shift+Enter for newline.
- Chat input supports Command+A, Command+C, Command+X, Command+V, and Command+Z.
- Command+Q is handled by the native browser host to quit the app.
- `/wallet status` checks read-only Phantom provider presence and connection state on the active page without requesting connection, signing, seed/private keys, credentials, or transaction submission.
- `/dao <goal>` prepares a read-only DAO workflow plan from the active page and stops before wallet connect, signing, voting, transfer, transaction confirmation, or public submission.
- `/wallet audit` and `/dao audit <goal>` save wallet/DAO browser evidence to raw Living Archive intake and queue review while preserving the same human-only wallet/signing/transaction boundary.
- DAO guidance and audit artifacts include a risk checklist covering domain, proposal identity, voting choice, quorum/threshold, treasury/token amounts, and transaction destination before any human-controlled wallet action.
- DAO fixture coverage now validates common governance controls and fields, including connect wallet, vote for/against/abstain, execute/queue transaction, treasury recipient, quorum, deadline, and treasury-transfer evidence.

### Email And Calendar Add-ons

- `/email` creates a host-mediated email draft packet from chat.
- `/calendar` creates a host-mediated calendar draft packet from chat.
- Draft packets are visible in the browser-first Add-ons workspace.
- Draft packets can be approved for manual action or rejected with an audit entry.
- Approved email draft packets can open a Gmail compose handoff URL for human review.
- Approved calendar draft packets can open a Google Calendar event-template handoff URL for human review.
- Provider handoff appends an auditable `Provider Handoff` event to the draft packet.
- ResonantOS does not send email through this route.
- ResonantOS does not schedule calendar events through this route.
- Gmail and Google Calendar handoffs do not expose provider credentials to the extension.
- Future send/schedule automation remains blocked until provider-specific account grants, approval flows, and audit trails exist.

### Browser Reading And Context

- Augmentor can read the active webpage through mediated content-script messages.
- Page observations include title, URL, visible text, viewport state, links, controls, editable fields, iframe summaries, and wallet-provider detection.
- Wallet-provider status can also be checked directly through a main-world read-only probe so the result reflects page-injected providers instead of isolated extension state.
- DAO workflow guidance can identify visible wallet/governance controls and fields and turn them into human-safe instructions while preserving wallet/signing boundaries.
- Readable iframe content is merged into page observations where browser security allows it.
- Stable element refs are assigned to visible controls and fields.
- Augmentor can use refs to avoid ambiguous click/type targets.
- The system keeps a controlled-tab binding so Augmentor acts on the intended webpage, not on the side-panel tab.
- Page context can be attached into chat.
- Inline selected text can be sent into the side panel.
- Browser history/activity search supports `/history <query> | site:example.com | days:7 | tabs`.
- History/activity search can filter by site, limit the date window, synthesize readable open tabs with history matches, and explicitly excludes incognito activity.
- History/activity search can save selected browser activity metadata to raw Living Archive intake with `/history <query> | intake`, creating a review request instead of writing trusted AI Memory directly.

### Agent Control Mode

- Agent Control Mode exists and runs through an observe -> decide -> act -> verify loop.
- Agent Control Mode can be triggered with `/control <goal>`.
- Natural browser-task phrasing can route into Agent Control Mode.
- The model is treated as a next-action controller, not as a raw browser automation authority.
- The host validates every proposed action.
- The loop is capped at a safety limit.
- The loop stops on blocked, failed, approval-required, paused, cancelled, or completed states.
- The loop records a durable browser job.
- The loop records step state as pending, active, completed, blocked, or failed.
- The control runner now writes result summaries into the step timeline.
- The control monitor now renders the task as a visible action timeline.
- The control monitor shows current status and progress.
- The control monitor persists job state through browser storage.
- Agent Control reports can be saved into Living Archive intake through the bridge path.
- Agent Control now classifies editable fields before typing: search/query submits and non-sensitive document/generic edits are allowed, while credential, login, payment, wallet, personal-contact, and non-search submit automation is blocked before any value is written.
- Agent Control now rejects ambiguous repeated click labels or editable field labels at the content-script boundary and returns bounded candidate refs, so Augmentor must retarget precisely instead of clicking or typing into the first matching control.
- Ambiguous target candidates persist into runner history, durable job state, recovery options, and saved reports so the next planner turn or human review can choose an exact visible ref without rediscovering the candidate list.
- Resumed durable browser jobs restore ambiguous target flags and candidate refs into planner history, preserving retargeting context after reload or continuation.
- Active monitor detail rows and expanded durable browser job rows show ambiguous-target candidate refs, so the user can see the exact retargeting options without opening the saved report artifact.
- Page snapshots and form detection exclude ResonantOS overlay/inline UI controls so Augmentor reads and targets the actual webpage, not its own control chrome.
- The Augmentor sidebar can save the current browser page or selected page text directly into Living Archive intake and immediately create a governed review request; these captures remain raw intake artifacts and still require review, verification, and promotion before becoming trusted AI Memory.
- The main workspace exposes matching icon affordances for page read, page save, selection save, and browser status/context summary, and runs those non-control operations directly from the main workspace chat surface.
- The Artifacts workspace extracts status, target, aggregate progress, and next-human-action summaries from browser-control/job reports so the user can understand saved evidence without opening raw markdown first.
- The Artifacts workspace groups saved evidence with counts for Agent Control, Browser Jobs, Browser Intake, Wallet/DAO audits, and other intake, so browser-collected memory does not become one undifferentiated pile.
- The Artifacts workspace extracts browser-source provenance from intake markdown, including page title, page URL, and capture timestamp when present.
- The Augmentor sidebar can summarize the current browser page into a source-grounded Living Archive intake artifact through the selected provider, with a deterministic source-excerpt fallback when the provider is unavailable.
- The Augmentor sidebar can capture a multi-tab browser research trail into one Living Archive intake artifact, preserving per-page visible text, links, tab provenance, skipped-tab reasons, and a governed review request.
- Trusted wiki promotion now maintains `AI_MEMORY/wiki/index.md` as a deduplicated content catalog by upserting the promoted page entry instead of blindly appending stale duplicates; `log.md` remains the append-only chronological record.
- Wiki health now detects duplicate `index.md` catalog entries so older or manually degraded memory indexes can be surfaced for repair instead of silently confusing future retrieval.
- AI Memory search is now index-aware: it reads `AI_MEMORY/wiki/index.md` as the first navigation layer, prioritizes catalog matches, and falls back to wiki page content when the index has not caught up.
- Living Archive bootstrap now creates the LLM Wiki schema file `AI_MEMORY/wiki/AGENTS.md`, standard memory domains, `index.md`, and `log.md` without overwriting existing user-maintained files.
- Draft wiki updates now include structured LLM Wiki sections: summary, source provenance, key claims, candidate entities/concepts, source structure, suggested links, contradiction/open-question markers, and maintenance notes.
- Draft wiki updates now prefer a configured archive ingest writer model for LLM-authored wiki pages, validate that the provider response follows the required LLM Wiki structure, and fall back to the deterministic writer when no provider is available or the response is malformed.
- Wiki health now checks visible source provenance and contradiction/open-question markers in addition to links, orphans, index coverage, duplicate index entries, and duplicate titles.
- The Living Archive MCP bridge used by external agents such as Hermes now shares the same index-first AI Memory search behavior and exposes wiki health findings through `living_archive_lint`.
- The Living Archive MCP memory service now supports the full deterministic portable loop: external agents can write intake and queue ingest, the service can process queued requests into review artifacts, approved artifacts can be promoted through a narrow trusted path, and promotion updates `AI_MEMORY/wiki`, `index.md`, and `log.md` without allowing arbitrary direct wiki writes.
- Browser artifacts can request Living Archive review, and the browser-first Living Archive workspace now exposes an auditable review queue with `pending`, `in-progress`, `approved`, and `rejected` state transitions.
- Review queue cards now show an archive pipeline timeline for `Intake`, `Review`, `Draft`, `Verify`, `Revise`, `Promote`, and `Restore`, using host-read artifact metadata rather than UI guesses.
- Approved browser-first review requests can generate draft wiki-update artifacts under `Memory/REVIEW/artifacts`; these drafts are not trusted AI Memory until a later host-mediated ingest/verifier/promote path completes.
- Draft wiki-update artifacts can be previewed through a scoped `REVIEW/artifacts` host read path before any trusted promotion work is attempted.
- Draft wiki-update artifacts must pass a host-owned verifier gate before promotion; the verifier writes an auditable verification artifact under `Memory/REVIEW/verifications` and records `verificationStatus: verified` on the draft.
- The verifier always runs deterministic host checks and can optionally call a configured provider for semantic challenge review; OpenAI is preferred for archive-quality verification, MiniMax is used as fallback, and unavailable provider review is recorded without exposing credentials.
- Verification artifacts can be previewed from the Living Archive workspace through a scoped `REVIEW/verifications` host read path before promotion.
- Drafts that fail verification can be revised through a scoped host route that creates a new draft from the source artifact plus verifier findings, marks the old draft as revised, and points the review request at the revised draft.
- Browser-first draft artifacts can now be explicitly promoted into `AI_MEMORY/wiki` through a scoped host action that requires an approved source review request, backs up overwritten wiki pages, marks the artifact as promoted, and appends to `index.md` / `log.md`.
- Browser-first promotion now uses section-aware markdown merge: matching `##` sections are updated, unmatched existing sections are preserved, new sections are appended, and superseded sections are retained for provenance.
- The browser-first Living Archive workspace now shows promotion history from promoted review artifacts, including the promoted wiki page and backup path when a page was overwritten.
- Promotion history can restore a promoted wiki page from its recorded backup through a scoped host action; the restore operation backs up the current page first and appends a restore event to the wiki log.

### Safety Boundaries

- Wallet actions are human-only by default.
- Wallet connect/sign/network-switch actions are blocked from automation.
- Payment, checkout, buy/sell, bridge, mint, claim, transfer, and signing actions are blocked from automation.
- Login and credential actions are blocked from automation.
- Public submit actions require approval.
- Non-search field submission requires approval.
- Site trust never bypasses wallet, payment, login, credential, signing, or public-submit boundaries.
- Planner-proposed actions are sanitized before execution.
- Restricted planner actions are blocked before reaching the content script where possible.
- Page mutation commands respect site permission state.

### Site Permissions

- Site permission modes exist:
- `blocked`: Augmentor cannot read or operate the site.
- `read-only`: Augmentor can read context but cannot click, type, or scroll.
- `ask-before-action`: default cautious posture.
- `trusted-for-safe-actions`: safe actions can run, but hard boundaries remain human-only.
- Current-site permission control appears in the side panel.
- `/site block`, `/site ask`, and related site-permission commands exist.
- Site permissions persist in extension storage.
- Site permission changes and resets record audit entries with timestamp, source, previous mode, new mode, and reason.
- The permission manager surfaces the latest site-permission audit evidence next to each stored site grant.
- Inline Assistant hides on blocked sites.

### Approval Flow

- Approval card appears for public-submit and similar gated actions.
- User can approve once for eligible public-submit style actions.
- User can deny an approval request.
- User can trust safe actions for a site only when the boundary is safe.
- The current-site context panel states what Augmentor can see and do now for each permission mode.
- Long autonomous Agent Control tasks now start with a task-class preflight before Augmentor operates the page.
- The preflight states the task class, site, permission mode, goal, what Augmentor may do, and which actions remain human-only.
- `/approve-control <id>` starts the governed run after the preflight.
- `/deny-control <id>` cancels the pending preflight without taking browser actions.
- The preflight also appears as a context-dock approval card with clickable Approve and Deny buttons.
- The preflight card can trust safe actions for the current site + task class through the same scoped task-consent store used by step approvals.
- Stored safe task-class consent can skip the preflight only for safe scoped tasks.
- Task-class consent grants and revocations record audit entries with timestamp, source, task class, mode, and reason.
- The permission manager surfaces the latest task-consent audit evidence next to each stored consent.
- Hard wallet/payment/login/credential boundaries do not expose an approval bypass.
- Denied actions stop the current task and preserve the record.

### Browser Job Monitor

- Browser jobs are durable in extension storage.
- The active browser job id is durable in extension storage.
- Interrupted running/approval jobs are recovered as paused after browser host or side-panel reload, with instructions to resume from persisted step history.
- The side panel shows job count and recent jobs.
- `/jobs` lists browser jobs.
- `/pause <job>` pauses a job.
- `/resume <job>` queues and immediately restarts a paused/queued/failed job from persisted step history.
- `/continue <job>` starts a continuation from persisted step history for any non-running job.
- `/report <job>` writes a durable Browser Job Report into Living Archive intake.
- `/cancel <job>` cancels a job.
- Job monitor can collapse/expand.
- Completed, blocked, approval, paused, cancelled, and running states are represented.
- Running, queued, and approval browser jobs hold explicit tab/site page locks.
- Agent Control start/resume is queued when another active job already owns the same page target; the scheduler keeps it lock-blocked until the page lock is released.
- Paused and terminal browser jobs release their page locks.
- A new explicit Agent Control request on the same page cancels an unresolved approval-paused job before starting, so the user is not trapped behind an old approval card.
- Expanded job monitor rows show the locked site/tab so the human can see why a conflicting control request is blocked.
- The durable job scheduler now computes capacity, runnable queued jobs, page-lock-blocked queued jobs, and capacity-waiting queued jobs.
- `/jobs` reports scheduler state so the human can see whether queued work is runnable, locked by another browser job, or waiting for execution capacity.
- Expanded job monitor rows show per-job scheduler state for queued jobs, including the blocking job id when a page lock prevents execution.
- The execution scheduler starts queued non-conflicting jobs, auto-drains capacity-waiting jobs after completions, preserves paused/cancelled jobs when a runner notices stop state, and prevents hard human-only boundaries from leaving approval jobs that hold locks.
- Scheduled browser jobs keep job-local page snapshots and clear shared page context before executing their steps, reducing context leakage between parallel jobs while browser mutations remain serialized through the host action lock.
- Scheduled background browser jobs no longer steal the currently focused browser job; if the stored active id points to a completed job while active work remains, the durable job store and main workspace shift attention to a live queued/running/approval/paused job while preserving explicit manual focus on completed jobs for review/reporting.
- `/jobs focus <job>` uses the same focus boundary as monitor controls, so focusing a background job activates its locked readable tab instead of only changing the stored active job id.
- Expanded job monitor rows show aggregate progress and the latest recommended next human action when blocked/failed job evidence contains blocker guidance.
- Expanded approval-state job rows show the pending action, reason, observed page title, URL, locked tab/site target, and a reminder to review the visible page before approving.
- Expanded job rows expose Focus, Pause, Cancel, Continue, Report, and persisted public-submit Approve/Deny controls where applicable.
- Live browser-host validation proves a background tab job can complete while another tab remains parked at a public-submit approval boundary.

### Agent Control Visual Feedback

- Agent Control Mode has a persistent green Matrix-style page perimeter overlay.
- Agent Control monitor now records structured action traces with observation, decision, action, result, and safety details.
- Agent Control run state now records durable run and step timing metadata.
- Control monitor details can show step elapsed duration where timing evidence exists.
- Saved Agent Control reports and Browser Job reports include elapsed duration where timing evidence exists.
- Agent Control steps now record confidence, uncertainty, and recommended next human action where evidence is available.
- Control monitor details and saved Agent Control reports expose confidence, uncertainty, and blocker guidance so the human can see why the agent stopped and what to do next.
- Agent Control runs now persist the controlled tab/site target and page-lock reason.
- The control monitor and saved reports show the controlled tab/site target so the human can see exactly what browser target Augmentor is operating.
- Agent Control runs now expose aggregate progress semantics: phase, percent complete, queued count, blocked count, failed count, and a compact progress track in the monitor.
- Saved Agent Control reports and Browser Job reports include aggregate progress evidence so replay artifacts show the task phase and completion state without reconstructing it from raw steps.
- Agent Control now rereads the page after successful click/type/open/search/tab-switch actions and records page-state verification evidence, including uncertainty when no visible page change is detected.
- Agent Control now performs one bounded settle-reread before recording no visible page change, preventing slow page updates from becoming false no-op blockers without repeating click/type actions.
- Agent Control can perform one precise-ref retry after a safe click produces no visible page change, but only when the current page exposes exactly one matching visible control ref and the action remains inside the safe boundary.
- Agent Control monitor details and saved reports now expose settle-reread and precise-ref retry evidence, so recovery behavior remains visible instead of becoming hidden automation.
- Durable Browser Job rows now surface the latest retry/recheck evidence after the live control monitor closes.
- The main workspace Agent Control strip now shows focused-job retry/recheck evidence when present.
- Agent Control now blocks completion when the latest browser mutation has no verified visible page-state change, adding a completion-verification blocker and saving it into the report artifact.
- Resumed Agent Control jobs now preserve stored verificationChanged, settle-reread, and precise-ref retry evidence in planner history.
- Agent Control now blocks repeated identical actions after no visible page-state change, preventing same-action loops and recording next-human-action guidance.
- Agent Control now records page-specific recovery options for failed, no-change, and repeat-blocked actions. These options are derived from the current page snapshot and list concrete visible controls/fields where possible.
- Recovery options are visible in the monitor detail rows, preserved in durable browser job state, and written into saved control/job reports.
- Agent Control planning and next-action requests now carry a deterministic task-class runbook with phases, safety stops, visible evidence, and completion checks.
- Strategy phase, strategy rationale, and completion-check evidence are preserved in monitor detail rows, durable browser job state, and saved control/job reports.
- Agent Control task classes now resolve into real-site scenario runbooks: shopping comparison/discovery, booking discovery, news/web research synthesis, DAO/wallet review, safe form editing, and generic page control.
- Each scenario runbook carries preferred probes, success signals, and stop conditions so Augmentor has concrete strategy before selecting a browser action.
- The active Agent Control monitor now renders a compact strategy card with the current scenario, phase, preferred probes, success signals, and stop boundaries.
- The active Agent Control monitor now renders a current-authority card describing visible browser context Augmentor can read, safe actions it may perform, and human-only boundaries such as wallet signing, payment, login, credentials, and public submission.
- Approved-once and denied browser actions now persist explicit approval-decision evidence in monitor details, durable browser job state, and saved reports.
- The durable browser job scheduler preserves blocked/approval/failed control-loop results instead of converting non-success browser jobs into completed jobs.
- The main full-screen workspace now renders a compact Agent Control status strip for active/queued/approval browser jobs, including focused job status, page target, scheduler counts, progress, and controls to open the full monitor, focus, or stop the job.
- The main workspace Agent Control status strip uses a dedicated browser-job controller for Open Monitor, Focus, and Stop so storage mutation, page-lock release, sidebar handoff prompts, and system trace messages are covered outside the UI renderer.
- The main workspace Agent Control status strip can now route focused jobs to the side-panel Pause and Continue command authority, so the full-screen workspace can control durable browser jobs without duplicating runner state mutation in the renderer.
- Background browser-job Focus and approval actions activate the job's locked readable tab before review/replay, so approval decisions remain page-specific instead of following the currently active tab by accident.
- The browser-job monitor labels visible-page ownership and background approval state, including the locked tab that will be activated before approve or deny.
- Durable Browser Jobs now detect stale running/approval jobs passively and surface last-activity timing plus next human action in `/jobs` and the monitor, without auto-killing, auto-resuming, or changing the persisted status.
- Blocked Agent Control tasks delegated to the Resonant Engineer now include a bounded context packet with source run id, browser target, aggregate progress, blocker reason, recent trace, and explicit safety boundary.
- The Add-ons workspace now lists recent Hermes/OpenCode/Engineer delegation packets and shows whether each handoff includes a bounded context packet.
- The Add-ons workspace now shows granted, pending, and denied capability chips for each visible add-on, and Hermes/OpenCode local-execution toggles route through scoped host execution settings instead of raw command access.
- Completed, blocked, approval, and denied control runs now show compact summary cards before the replayable action list.
- The overlay starts once when the agent begins operating the page.
- The overlay remains active across the whole control session.
- The overlay stops only when control returns to the human.
- The overlay has continuous animated wave/pixel movement.
- The overlay shows a bottom in-page action toast.
- The target element is highlighted when the agent clicks or types.
- A temporary in-page action bubble appears over the target element when the agent acts.
- The action bubble is part of the tested content-script contract.

### Inline Assistant

- Inline Assistant appears when the user selects text on a permitted webpage.
- Inline Assistant supports summarize, explain, fact-check, translate, rewrite, custom ask, send to side panel, and insert actions.
- Inline Assistant custom prompt input exists.
- Inline Assistant now captures editable selections inside inputs, textareas, and contenteditable surfaces.
- Inline Assistant Insert replaces only the selected editable range instead of overwriting the entire field.
- Inline Assistant actions render visible keyboard shortcuts from the configured action list.
- Inline Assistant can send selected page context to the Augmentor side panel.
- Inline Assistant is hidden on blocked sites.

### Browser History And Page Commands

- Browser history metadata search exists through `/history`.
- Browser history metadata can be exported to governed intake with `/history <query> | intake`.
- `/capabilities` explains what Augmentor can do on the current page.
- `/browser read` reads the current page.
- `/browser forms` inspects forms.
- `/browser click "text"` clicks visible text where safe.
- `/browser type "text"` types into the active/available editable field.
- `/browser scroll down/up/top/bottom` scrolls the page.

### Provider Bridge

- Browser-first uses a local loopback bridge for provider and memory operations.
- The bridge requires an auth token.
- The bridge does not allow unauthenticated localhost requests.
- The bridge does not expose raw provider credentials to the extension.
- The bridge can execute Augmentor chat calls.
- The bridge can execute Inline Assistant calls.
- The bridge can execute control-plan and next-action calls.
- The bridge can expose memory status/search/intake operations.

### Deterministic Validation Already Passing

- Latest restricted sandbox checkpoint on 2026-06-01: `node --test browser-first/test/browser-first-acceptance.test.mjs` passed and covers the fresh main-chat -> natural current-news prompt -> side-panel Agent Control handoff, plus governed parallel browser jobs with page locks, approval focus, and main-workspace status rendering.
- Latest restricted sandbox checkpoint on 2026-06-01: `git diff --check && npm run test:browser-first` passed with 364 tests and 8 explicit localhost-bridge skips caused by sandbox bind restrictions.
- Latest restricted sandbox checkpoint on 2026-06-01: `npm run build` passed with the existing Vite large chunk warning.
- Latest restricted sandbox checkpoint on 2026-06-01: `npm test -- --run` passed with 286 tests.
- Latest local checkpoint on 2026-05-31: `npm run test:browser-first` passed with 310 tests.
- Latest local checkpoint on 2026-05-31: `npm run build` passed.
- Latest unrestricted local checkpoint on 2026-05-31: `npm run test:browser-first-live` passed and covered Agent Control plus multi-tab browser jobs.
- Restricted sandbox checkpoint on 2026-05-31: `npm run test:browser-first-live` exits cleanly with an explicit skip when localhost binding is denied by the sandbox.
- Restricted sandbox installed-app checkpoint on 2026-05-31: `npm run browser-first:verify-installed` falls back from sandboxed LaunchServices `kLSNoExecutableErr` false negatives to the validated launcher executable, then reports the real local bridge `EPERM` boundary instead of a misleading missing-executable claim.
- `npm run test:browser-native`: passed in the prior full chain for the current branch.
- `npm test -- --run`: passed in the prior full chain for the current branch.
- `npm run browser-first:install`: passed and installed `~/Applications/ResonantOS Browser.app`.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

Known validation note: Vite still reports the existing large chunk warning in the desktop build. This warning is not caused by the browser-first Agent Control changes.

## 2. Browser-First Features We Are About To Add

These are the next capability areas planned for the browser-first app.

### Agent Control Quality

- Refine the control monitor with richer aggregate progress semantics and clearer multi-step task phases. Initial aggregate phase/progress evidence is now implemented; next work is to propagate the same clarity into non-control workspace blockers.
- Add visible blockers with recommended next human action in more workspace surfaces beyond Agent Control. Initial job-monitor, Artifacts workspace, Hermes workspace, OpenCode workspace, and delegation lifecycle guidance are implemented; next work is to expand the same pattern into future add-on workspaces.
- Add better progress semantics for multi-step tasks. Initial monitor/report progress semantics are implemented; next work is richer phase-specific copy and recovery actions.
- Add per-job approval-card routing for background jobs. Implemented in the main workspace status strip as compact approval cards that route the human to the focused Browser Jobs review before approve/deny; the side-panel monitor remains the approval execution surface.
- Improve replayable run reports with richer aggregate progress and confidence evidence. Initial aggregate progress and confidence evidence is now present in saved reports.
- Add clearer distinction between reading, deciding, acting, verifying, blocked, and waiting.

### Agent Control Browser Capability

- Improve page observation quality for complex modern web apps. Initial open-shadow-DOM read/type discovery is implemented for visible controls and editable fields while keeping closed shadow roots inaccessible and sensitive values redacted.
- Improve element targeting when the page has repeated labels.
- Add stronger form-field mapping beyond the current secure autofill guard. Initial accessible-label evidence is implemented for `label[for]` and `aria-labelledby`, so planner targeting can refer to visible field names while sensitive value redaction remains enforced.
- Add better editable document handling.
- Add page-state verification after actions.
- Add more robust tab-aware workflows.
- Add multi-tab tasks with explicit safe tab switching.
- Improve controlled-tab visibility across more workspace surfaces beyond the Agent Control monitor and saved reports.
- Deepen action recovery after no visible page change. A bounded settle-reread and one safe precise-ref click retry now exist; future work should add other alternative-action retries only when they can stay behind the same approval and safety gates.
- Add page-specific task adapters only when they can stay behind the same safety boundaries.

### Consent And Permission UX

- Add task-class consent history.
- Add “allow once for this task class” for safe task classes.
- Add clearer “what Augmentor can see/do now” inside the control monitor.
- Add better human-intervention states for login, wallet, checkout, and public submit.
- Add better site permission explanations.
- Add audit trail for approvals and denials.

Current browser-first implementation note:

- The side-panel context dock now includes a permission manager that lists stored site permission overrides and task-class safe-action consents across sites.
- The permission manager can reset a site permission back to the default `ask-before-action` posture.
- The permission manager can revoke task-class safe-action consents without granting any new capability.
- Wallet, payment, login, credential, signing, and public-submit boundaries remain human-only.

### Memory And Archive Integration In Browser-First

- Connect browser-first Agent Control reports more deeply to Living Archive intake.
- Improve saved page/context artifacts with richer metadata and user-facing artifact previews. Browser-control/job report artifacts now show derived action summaries, and the Artifacts workspace now filters report/intake categories with visible counts.
- Improve browser-collected source provenance beyond current page title, URL, and capture-time previews with deeper source-type-specific artifact summaries.
- Keep direct trusted wiki writes blocked; browser artifacts must enter intake/review.

### Add-on Integration In Browser-First

- Expand the browser-first Add-ons workspace from current visibility/status, capability review, and Hermes/OpenCode local-execution toggles into future install/uninstall/update flows.
- Expose Hermes and OpenCode as controlled add-on targets from both the browser-first main workspace and side panel.
- Route delegation through approved add-on manifests, not raw command execution.
- Hermes/OpenCode blocked delegation states now show a structured reason, next action, and trust boundary so the user can recover the runtime without mistaking add-on agents for trusted core agents.
- Add task handoff artifacts from browser-first Agent Control into delegation workspaces.
- Keep add-ons untrusted by default.
- Email and Calendar now have manual provider handoff connectors; future account-level connectors still need explicit grants and stronger audit/approval flows.

### Wallet And DAO Workflows

- Keep Phantom inside the same browser profile.
- Add wallet state detection without raw signing power.
- Add dApp fixture tests around wallet provider presence.
- Add explicit wallet approval UX for human-only actions.
- Add DAO workflow helpers that read pages, prepare instructions, and stop before signing/submitting.
- Add audit trail for wallet-adjacent tasks. Implemented v1 as read-only Living Archive intake artifacts with review requests.

### Browser Product Surface

- Improve the side-panel chat layout further.
- Add stronger compact mode for current site and browser jobs.
- Add better keyboard shortcut coverage.
- Add settings surfaces for provider, memory, permissions, and extension state.
- Add first-run onboarding for browser-first ResonantOS.
- Add export/debug report for support.

## 4. Current Gaps And Risks

- Browser-first is now the product direction, but not all desktop vNext modules have been ported into it.
- Living Archive is complete for desktop V1 architecture, but browser-first memory UX is not complete.
- Browser-first add-on management now surfaces capability review plus Hermes/OpenCode local-execution toggles; future work still needs install, uninstall, update, and marketplace/registry flows.
- Hermes and OpenCode delegation now have browser-first production lifecycle foundations: governed task packets, host-mediated start/status/artifact/cancel routes, deterministic execution coverage, Add-ons workspace result reading, and explicit opt-in before real local CLI execution. Both enabled-CLI adapter paths are tested with fake executables so the production handoff, parser, and artifact contracts are validated without relying on a live user runtime. OpenCode execution is scoped to the ResonantOS repository boundary for browser-first V1.
- Augmentor chat can now report recent delegated work through `/delegations` or `/handoffs`, including target, status, result excerpt, artifact link, and packet path, so Hermes/OpenCode work is visible without manually opening the Add-ons workspace.
- Hermes runtime status is now available from chat with `/hermes` or `/hermes status`. The add-on contract is treated as bundled in browser-first ResonantOS, while the local Hermes CLI runtime is reported separately as detected/not detected and execution enabled/disabled.
- Wallet actions intentionally stop at human approval boundaries; automated signing is not a goal.
- Browser-first provider credentials depend on the local bridge and provider secrets path.
- Browser-first validation is strong locally on this Mac, but cross-platform browser-first packaging needs its own CI path.
- The old desktop/Tauri app and new browser-first app currently coexist in the repository; documentation must keep the distinction explicit.

## 5. Recommended Next Implementation Sequence

1. **Agent Control UX vNext**
   - Add richer action details, current action state, blockers, and completion cards.
   - Reason: this directly improves the Comet-level experience the user sees every day.

2. **Browser-First Memory Bridge UX**
   - Add save page, save selection, research trail intake flows, and promotion from approved draft artifacts into the existing trusted ingest/verifier pipeline.
   - Reason: this connects the browser product to the LLM Wiki / Living Archive advantage.

3. **Browser-First Add-on Surface**
   - Expose installed/available add-ons and route delegation to approved add-ons.
   - Reason: this restores the ResonantOS modular platform vision inside the browser app.

4. **Hermes/OpenCode Delegation**
   - Add controlled task handoff and artifact return.
   - Reason: this makes Augmentor more powerful without giving add-ons trusted core authority.

5. **Wallet/DAO Workflow Guardrails**
   - Add DAO helpers, wallet state detection, and audit trail while keeping signing human-only.
   - Reason: this supports ResonantDAO use cases without compromising security.

6. **Browser-First Onboarding And Settings**
   - Add provider, memory, permissions, add-ons, and diagnostics settings inside the browser-first app.
   - Reason: the product needs to be usable without terminal/config knowledge.
